# Michael Giannattasio Project Portfolio

Hi! My name is Michael Giannattasio. I recieved my B.S. in Mathematics with minors in Data Science and Economics from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in 2024 and my M.S. in Business Analytics in Spring 2025. I am actively seeking a job!

This GitHub page serves as a hub for some of the projects from my data science journey. These projects include both personal development of skills and the understanding of AI/ML algorithms and direct application of data science techniques to a myriad of problems and data sources.

This repository focuses on personal projects, but here are some repository links for larger projects I have worked on:

[IDEA/CRAFT DeFi Survival Analysis Toolkit](https://github.rpi.edu/DataINCITE/DeFi_App/wiki)
